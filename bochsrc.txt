# When 'clock' is commented out, Bochs will run much faster. There are two
# drawbacks with this:
#
#  * The Floppix login normally timesout after 60 seconds, but when
#    Bochs is run in 'accelerated' mode, the timeout is extremely
#    short. Depending on the speed of your machine, you may have
#    two seconds (or less) to type your password.
#
#  * A CPU core runs at 100%, even when Floppix is idle, which
#    may cause unwanted heating. (When using 100% CPU, clicking
#    on Suspend on the headerbar will pause the CPU and Bochs.)
